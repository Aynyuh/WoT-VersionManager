# WoT Version Manager
![Build](https://github.com/Manderius/WoT-VersionSwitcher/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

World of Tanks Version Manager is a free tool to archive your older WoT versions.
It can save up to 50 % of space used by World of Tanks clients.

When you import a World of Tanks client of any version into the application, Version Manager compares its files to other versions you have imported previously.
Different files get saved into Version Manager's directory and a new game folder is created for your imported version.

## Replays
Using the "Replays" tab, you can select any replay to display its details. If you have a matching game version imported, you can also play the replay using the correct client.
No more micropatches ruining your replays!

## How to use
This section only contains basic usage. For more info, see [Download and Help](#download-and-help).

1. Make sure you have enough space on your disk. This application will copy WoT client files to a new location, so you need to have at least 40 GB of free space.
1. Go to "Import game client" and select one of the WoT client directories. You can also select your main client.
1. Start the import process and wait until it's completed. This process might take up to 30 minutes.
1. Once the import finishes, go to "Overview" and verify that the imported version works (you can also play a replay through the "Replays" tab).
1. If everything works, you can delete the old client directory. It is now saved inside WoT Version Manager. (Do not delete your main WoT client.)
1. Repeat steps 2 - 5 for every WoT version you have.
